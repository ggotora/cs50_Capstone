Design a site where truckers can get loads online and shippers can post their loads
![](posts.png)
### Distinctiveness and Complexity
 The LoadMaster WebApp is a online loadboard platform to
connect shippers, brokers, and carriers to find loads for transporting freight. Shippers and brokers can post available loads and carriers can view load listings, book a load, cancel booking within 24hrs, change status to delivered 
- the Project has two apps, main and loads
    1. the main app takes care of user profiles and home screen 
        - main app has User and Profile models
    2. The loads app is for location and load listings, details, updates and deletion
        - loads app has 3 models, Location, Load and LoadStatus

### Specification
<hr>
Using Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, complete the implementation of a webapp that allows user to post available loads, book a load, cancel booking within 24hrs, change status to delivered

- **main:home:** A home screen with a welcome page. Unauthenticated users can see the latest 5 listings without rates and shipper contact information
- **main:login:** Existing users can login with username and password or third party Google credentials 
- **main:signup:** A new profile is automatically created for all newly signed user. Users can optionally sign up using third party Google authentication 
- **main:incomplete_profile** all new users are automatically directed to this page to complete their profile giving more company details.
- **main:profile:** Authenticated users can view their profile page with user details: organisation, phone number, email and image 
- **main:update_profile** SExisting profile can update personal information - organisation, phone number, image, email 
- **loads:loads:** Users who are signed in should be able to see all load listings with <span style="color:green;">"Available"</span> status
- **loads:new_load:** Signed in users can post new loads and add a <span style="color: green">new location</span> if the location they need is not listed in <span style="color:orange">origin</span> and <span style="color:orange">destination</span> fields
- **loads:load_detail:** 
    - Signed in users can view shipper information and load details
    - if loadStatus is <span style="color:green;">Available</span>, users other than owner that posted the load, can book the load for shipping, in which case the loadStatus is changed to <span style="color:green">"In Transit"</span>
    - Once loadStatus is <span style="color:green">"In Transit"</span> the user can ship the load and change loadStatus to <span style="color:green">"Delivered"</span> Delivered. 
    - NB: The user can only cancel <span style="color:green">"In Transit"</span> or booked loads within 24 hours while owner can unbook the load and change loadStatus to <span style="color:green">"Available"</span> at any time
    - Clicking on "more loads from shipper" button takes user to load listings from the shipper
- **loads:load_update:** Owner can update any load they posted 
- **loads:my_bookings** Users see all the loads that they booked and are "In <span style="color:green">Transit"</span> and <span style="color:green">"Delivered"</span>. Clicking any load listed will take then to load_details
- **loads:my_loads** Users can view all the loads they have posted. Clicking a specific load will take them to load_detail page. 
- **loads:shipper_details** User can see a list of loads posted by a specific shipper/broker  


-**Pagination:** On any page that displays posts, posts should only be displayed 10 on a page. If there are more than ten posts, a ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button should appear to take the user to the next page of posts (which should be older than the current page of posts). If not on the first page, a ‚ÄúPrevious‚Äù button should appear to take the user to the previous page of posts as well.

-**Edit Post:** Users should be able to click an ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button or link on any of their own posts to edit that post.
   - when a user clicks ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù for one of their own posts, the content of their post should be replaced with a textarea where the user can edit the content of their post.
   - The user should then be able to ‚ÄúSave‚Äù the edited post. Using JavaScript, you should be able to achieve this without requiring a reload of the entire page.
   - For security, ensure that your application is designed such that it is not possible for a user, via any route, to edit another user‚Äôs posts.

-**"Like" and "Unlike":** Users should be able to click a button or link on any post to toggle whether or not they ‚Äúlike‚Äù that post.
- Using JavaScript, you should asynchronously let the server know to update the like count (as via a call to fetch) and then update the post‚Äôs like count displayed on the page, without requiring a reload of the entire page.
